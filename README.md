Advanced Distributed Systems
Replicated Log Problem

By: Kine Johnsrud

My program is written in Java, using the Eclipse IDE.

The program contains four classes. The Main-class ReplicatedLog.java, and three classes Event.java, Transmission.java and Replica.java that defines some objects I made.

I have not made any fancy GUI, but solved it by prompting for inputs in the console.
